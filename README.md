# Analyzing Performance of Network Storage using Python.

## About

Using this Python program, developed by me, _Rusif Eyvazli_, you can graph a line plot using data file. The challenge in this task was to read the data from the given file which was mixed up with the notes by the data producer. To be able to read the data and get the resulted graph, the data were first filtered out by first two and last columns, then important three columns derived from the resulted data frame and plotted using Seaborn package.

## How to run
To run the program, please use the following command:

`python Performance.py 072419-SampleData`

You can add _-title_ and _-width_ optional arguments to the command as following:

`python Performance.py 072419-SampleData -title "Performance for July" -width 0.3`


_Let me know, if there are any recommendations or issues._
